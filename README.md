**2018 October - No longer maintained. A new repository is being created in order to provide and maintain a reference implementation organised in separate data sets, as specified by the 16th Edition of the ICAO Annex 15.**

Donlon
======

This is a fictitious AIXM 5.1 data set, based on the content of the ICAO "AIP Sample" as contained in the ICAO AIS Manual (DOC 8126). It has been augmented with other features and data items (such as valid times, changes, Digital NOTAM records, etc.) that do not exist in the ICAO Document.

This data is entirely fictitious, located somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. It shall NEVER BE USED AS OPERATIONAL DATA. There is no Donlon airport in the middle of the Atlantic!!!

Update policy
-------------

* Anyone can create pull requests.
* Obvious editorial errors (such as a broken link, etc.), will be merged directly if not opposed by anyone after a review time of 2 working days. The review time would allow for a sanity check of the correction that is proposed.
* Improvements (such as adding new data in the file, modifying existing data for something else then a typing error) will be merged if explicitly supported by at least two other members of the contributors group and not opposed by anyone after a review time of 5 working days. Support/opposition is to be expressed through a comment made on that pull request.
* In order to ensure that a minimal sanity check was done, the pull request shall be merged by a person different from the originator of the request.
