This is a fictitious AIXM 5.1 data set, based on the content of the ICAO "AIP Sample" as contained in the ICAO AIS Manual (DOC 8126). It has been augmented with other features and data items (such as valid times, changes, Digital NOTAM records, etc.) that do not exist in the ICAO Document.

This data is entirely fictitious, located somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. It shall NEVER BE USED AS OPERATIONAL DATA. There is no Donlon airport in the middle of the Atlantic!!!
